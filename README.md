# CP1404 Assignment 2 - Movies to Watch 2.0 by YOUR_NAME

A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of *Movies to Watch*.


# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
The second assignment took just over 25 hours to complete. 

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I am extremely satisfied with my understanding of classes and Kivy. When I first started the project I was clueless
with using classes. As I spent more and more time messing around with them my understanding of them finally grew.
This was the same case with Kivy, I didn't really understand the concept of the MVC framework or the kv language
as a whole. After thoroughly analysing the KivyDemos I somewhat understand what was happening. But it wasn't until
I created the basic structure of the GUI that I understand what was going on.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
I'm not very satisfied with my use of methods / functions with regard to the Single Responsibility Principle. I feel
as though within my MoviesToWatchApp the methods are quite large and have more than one responsibility. I think the
reason for this is that I don't fully understand under which circumstances an exception to the rule may be granted. 

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
I think that the testing phase of my development process worked surprisingly well. The tests I ran for the Movie and
MovieCollection Class seemed to prove relevant, efficient and easy to read. As the tests were well written, the majority
of the time the tests passed with no syntax or logic errors.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
My development process could be improved next time I do a project similar to this by moving up the timeline and
starting the project at an earlier date. Doing so, will hopefully prevent me from being under the gun and completing the
project an hour before the deadline! Additionally, starting earlier will allow me to have a few contingency days in the
case of any problems. 

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
Throughout the course of the project I used a wide range of learning resources. This includes; heavily analysing all
.py and .kv files from the KivyDemos folder, reviewing the Kivy and Classes lecture slides, re-watching lecture videos,
often referring to the CP1404 Programming Patterns GitHub page and finally attending PASS sessions at 1pm every friday.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The first and most major challenge I encountered during the project was loading the movies from the file using a method
in the MovieCollection class. I was still struggling conceptually with the way the collection would work with regard to
it's movies list attribute. After hours of messing, pure determination as well as attending PASS I finally understand
what needed to be done. Once I was able to load movies I was then able to complete the rest of the class's methods
promptly. Another obstacle I faced was understanding BoxLayouts within the kv language. Again, I was finding it difficult
to conceptually understand how they stack on each other or within each other. I overcame this issue by adapting the
guitar_app, squaring and MVC_demo from the KivyDemos into my own project and playing around with it until eventually
I got what I needed.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
As aforementioned, initially my experience using classes was un-enjoyable and filled me with great rage. However,
through perseverance I soon learned the importance of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Being able to create reusable
data types that simplify and modularise my program significantly improved the quality and readability of my code.
